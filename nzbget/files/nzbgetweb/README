1. About NZBGetWeb
=====================================

NZBGetWeb is a web-frontend for NZBGet-server. 

NZBGetWeb is written in PHP and can be installed on any server 
with PHP-support.

=====================================
2. Prerequisites
=====================================

NZBGetWeb needs:

 - NZBGet-server:
    This version of NZBGetWeb (1.3) requires NZBGet 0.6.0 or later.

 - PHP:
    Version 5.2 or later is recommended. For early versions additional steps
    may be required (see Installation-section for details).
    
 - Web-server:
    any server with PHP-support, for example Apache.

=====================================
3. Installation
=====================================

Extract the content of archive to any folder on your server. 

Please refer to documentation of your web-server for information on how
to enable PHP-support and to define permissions to execute scripts.

Check your PHP-version. For version 5.2 or later no additional libraries
are needed. 

For early versions of PHP you need to install the extensions
"xml" and "xmlrpc".
On windows the extension "xml" is always installed, the extension "XMLRPC" needs
to be selected in Setup-program.
On linux the extensions should be available as packages "php-xml" and "php-xmlrpc".
If not - you can recompile PHP with configure option "--with-xmlrpc".

As a last option (if you have troubles installing extensions "xml" and "xmlrpc")
you can use the library ("XMLRPC for PHP"): download it from 
http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/ , unpack it and put the directory "lib" 
from the archive into the nzbgetweb-directory. However "XMLRPC for PHP" is much
slower as the mentioned extensions, written in "C".

To access nzbgetweb open url to nzbgetweb in your browser, for example:

  http://localhost/nzbgetweb/index.php

To open mini-theme open "mini.php" instead of "index.php":

  http://localhost/nzbgetweb/mini.php

NZBGetWeb will probably complain about not being able to connect to 
NZBGet-server. Click on the link "config" (which points to 
http://localhost/nzbgetweb/config.php) and check/change the options under
the section "COMMUNICATION WITH NZBGET-SERVER", especially "ServerIp", 
"ServerPort" and "ServerPassword".

If you want to be able to edit configuration of NZBGet-server via web-interface 
set the options "ServerConfigFile" and "ServerConfigTemplate". If you want
to start and shutdown NZBGet-server via web-interface set the option
"ServerStartCommand".

If you want to be able to edit configuration of your post-processing script 
via web-interface set the options "PostProcessConfigFile" and 
"PostProcessConfigTemplate". Your post-processing script must support the
configuration via web-interface (the sample post-processing script from
nzbget's distrubution does not support that).

If you get error messages by saving the config it is most likely a permission 
problem. If you can't fix it, do the configuration manually: create a copy of 
file "settings-template.php" with the name "settings.php" and edit the settings
using a text editor. NOTE: do not delete/rename file "settings-template.php", 
it is also neccessary.
