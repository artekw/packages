nzbgetweb 1.3 (testing):
  - added configuration page (config.php) for settings of web-interface,
    NZBGet-server and post-processing script;
  - added the commands to start and shutdown NZBGet-server;
  - removed the check for file nzb-extensions by uploading files, since 
    NZBGet can now process other files too (via nzbprocess-script);
  - reworked the storing of settings to make the updates of web-interface
    easier in the future (old settings can be keeped, new settings will be
    automatically initialized with default values);
  - the name of all settings were changed in order to be more consistent with
    NZBGet-server (no underscores, FirstWordUpperCase);
  - added the fetching of newzbin-reports (thanks to Phil Tolson 
    <phil-t@users.sourceforge.net> for the patch);
  - improved error reporting, if connection to server fails.

nzbgetweb 1.2:
  - added mini-theme (mini.php) as alternative for default theme (index.php), 
    optimized for PDA, mobile phones and other devices with very small screen
    and limited support for javascript.

nzbgetweb 1.1:
  - added support for categories; new option "categories";
  - if a connection to nzbget-server cannot be established, nzbgetweb now shows
    an appropriate error-page instead of a lot of php-errors;
  - added the output of timestamps in log-window; new option "log_time_format";
  
nzbgetweb 1.0:
  - first version;
